{
  !! Test: Level-skipping search finds CONSTANIC value
  !! When identifier found but its value is CONSTANIC -> wrapped in CMFir

  !! Create a CONSTANIC binding
  badValue = undeclaredIdentifier;  !! CONSTANIC

  !! Reference it from nested brane
  nested = {
    x = badValue;  !! Should be CONSTANIC (found but value is CONSTANIC)
  };

  !! Chain of CONSTANIC
  y = badValue;  !! CONSTANIC
  z = y;  !! CONSTANIC (y is CONSTANIC)
}

!!!
PARSED AST:
{
  badValue = undeclaredIdentifier;
  nested = {
    x = badValue;
  };
  y = badValue;
  z = y;
}

UBC EVALUATION:
Steps taken: 52

FINAL RESULT:

＿nested = ???;
＿y = ⎵⎵;
＿z = ⎵⎵;
