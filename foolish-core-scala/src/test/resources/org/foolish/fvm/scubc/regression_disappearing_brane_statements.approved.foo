{
    !! Regression test for disappearing brane statements
    !! When a parse error occurs mid-brane, subsequent statements should still be attempted
    !! This tests that parse errors don't cause silent statement omission

    !! These statements should parse correctly
    a = 1;
    b = 2;
    c = 3;

    !! This statement has invalid syntax and should cause a parse error
    !! The syntax "d =$ 4" is invalid (should be "d = 4$" or similar)
    d =$ 4;

    !! These statements come AFTER the parse error
    !! The question is: do they disappear from the AST?
    e = 5;
    f = 6;
    g = 7;
}

!!!
PARSED AST:
{
  a = 1;
  b = 2;
  c = 3;
  d =$4;
  e = 5;
  f = 6;
  g = 7;
}

＿c = 3;
＿d = ???;
＿e = 5;
