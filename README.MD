The Foolish language is a computer programming language. The language is specified to grow as we find the market fit for it in this age of rapidly expanding AI usage.

Foolish language begins as an exercise in vibe programming. We use AI to generate much of the code for a simplistic functional programming language. This language has simple concept of a "brane" that largely resembles code blocks, lambda's, struct, class, enum and other similar constructs in modern day programming languages. To that end, it is curly bracket enclosed block of statements. Statements in Foolish are simply assignments of an expression to a name. Statements can also just be an express, the name is anonymized in this case. Brane, once understood, can be inspected for it's values at a certain key, or a certain line/statement number. It is permitted to assign to the same name repeatedly. The language facilitates retrieval of the values in it's syntax.

Branes having unbound symbols are permitted. They are essentially brane functions. Function invocation, along with many other programing concepts such as concatenation, derivation, extending classes and traits, are all accomplished by brane concatenation. So to call a function `F` using parameters listed in brane `F`, the reverse polish expression creates the exact condition for invocation `P F` concatenates `P` infront of `F` setting values to names that `F` will use.
