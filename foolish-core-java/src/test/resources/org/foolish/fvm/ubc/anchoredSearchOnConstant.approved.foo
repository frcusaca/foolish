  !! Test: Anchored search on CONSTANT brane
  !! When a brane is CONSTANT and search succeeds, result is CONSTANT

  b = {α = 100; β = 200;};

  !! Head and tail searches on constant brane
  head = b^;  !! Should be CONSTANT 100
  tail = b$;  !! Should be CONSTANT 200

  !! Pattern search on constant brane (found)
  found = b?α;  !! Should be CONSTANT 100
}
