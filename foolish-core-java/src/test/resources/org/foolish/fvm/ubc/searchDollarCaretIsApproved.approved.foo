{
	!! Test for $ and ^ as postfix operators (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
	!! Based on NAME_SEARCH_AND_BOUND.md sections:
	!! - "Backward Search from End": $ finds last value
	!! - "Forward Search from Beginning": ^ finds first value

	!! NOTE: Currently $ and ^ only work as regex anchors within ? patterns
	!! They are not yet implemented as standalone postfix operators
	!! These examples show the documented specification

	!! $ as regex anchor - this works
	last_match = {alice=1; charlie=2; bob=3;}?e$;

	!! ^ as regex anchor - this works
	first_match = {alice=1; adam=2; advent=3;}?^a.*;

	!! TODO: Implement $ and ^ as postfix operators:
	!! last_val = {x=1; y=2; z=3;}$;        !! Should be 3
	!! first_val = {a=10; b=20; c=30;}^;    !! Should be 10
	!! single_dollar = {value=42;}$;        !! Should be 42
	!! single_caret = {value=99;}^;         !! Should be 99
}
