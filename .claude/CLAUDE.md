Minimally refer to README.md and docs/STYLES.md for common terminologies. Other documents in the docs/
directory prodvide additional details when something is ambiguous. Summary of long thinking/programming
tasks should always be in the format of git commit message. git commit message should include current
version of the claude agent as well as identifier of model used to create it. There is a 'mvnw' script
generated to use a more recent version of maven, please use that script in place of a 'mvn' call into
system folder installation. When presenting a command that moves `received` approval files to `approved`
make sure to accompany that command with a shell script comment above containing a copy/paste-able one-liner
that shows the diff's between `received` and previous `approved` files.
