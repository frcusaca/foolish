# TODO Items

Other features that we want to expand documentation on in the future:

* Document the call-by-value versus call-by-reference semantics: Does it matter?
* When does Foolishness become concrete and when is it still Foolish?
* Loops, Recursions, etc.
* Characterization
  * Characterize some names as system-generated, e.g. branching.
* Traceability.
* Enhanced refactoring and intervention in computation.
* Restatable programs for better comprehension and compression.
* Generation of programs.
* Program differentiation.
* Program optimization.
* AI adaptations to support Foolish language.
* Human-in-the-loop programming.
* Mutable branes. There is not much one can do to a brane. Given any line in the brane: it can be
  deleted, appended, prepended, name changed, or value changed.
* Translation versus Transformation.
* Specify the "Thought Block": how to stop evaluation.
* Define more precisely the verb `to fool`.
* Homomorphic encryption and equivalent "thought block" builtin.
* Asynchronized execution.
* Real-time computations.
* Built-in masking of data from compute.
* Library ecosystem for interactivity with Python/Java/C++/Rust/Go/etc. Other popular open systems
  such as PyTorch, R, Octave, Apache systems such as Ray, Spark, Arrow, standards such as JSON,
  XML, HTML, PPML, ONNX, Protocol Buffers, etc.
