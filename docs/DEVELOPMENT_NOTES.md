# Development Notes

- Concatenation is adjacency of brane-valued expressions (RPN), left-to-right; association is
  immaterial for denotation.

The Foolish language is a computer programming language environment. The language is specified to
grow as we find the market fit for it in this age of rapidly expanding AI usage.

Foolish language begins as an exercise in vibe programming. We use AI to generate much of the code
for a simplistic functional programming language. This language has a simple concept of a "brane"
that largely resembles code blocks, lambdas, structs, classes, enums, records, and other similar
constructs in modern-day programming languages. To that end, it is a curly-bracket-enclosed block
of statements. Statements in Foolish are simply assignments of an expression to a name. Statements
can also just be an expression; the name is anonymized in this case. Branes, once understood, can
be inspected for their values at a certain key, or a certain line/statement number. It is permitted
to assign to the same name repeatedly. The language facilitates retrieval of all of its values,
convenienced by syntactical sugaring.

Branes having unbound symbols are permitted. They are essentially brane functions. Function
invocation, along with many other programming concepts such as concatenation, derivation, extending
classes and traits, are all accomplished by brane concatenation. So to call a function `F` using
parameters listed in brane `P`, the reverse-polish expression creates the exact condition for
invocation: `P F` concatenates `P` in front of `F`, setting values to names that `F` will use.
Derivation simply concatenates updates to the end of the brane.

Note, this foolishness is unrelated to other previous efforts that may have used the name Foolish
for the name of a language. However, I'm sure we're similarly inspired by the same foolhardy
impulses to this level of lunacy.

There's some kind of very permissive software license on the code and ideas expressed here. Please
use foolishly, but do give back to the originators and contributors of this project so as to
sustain either their work and lives, or otherwise at least keep alive the spirit to develop despite
our fatuity.
