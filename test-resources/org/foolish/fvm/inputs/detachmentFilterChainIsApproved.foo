[α = 1;][β = 2;][γ = 3;]{
	!! Filter chain semantics: [d1][d2][d3]{B}
	!! When searching for identifier v:
	!!   1. Search finds match in parent scope
	!!   2. d3 (γ=3, rightmost) decides: block or not?
	!!   3. d2 (β=2) can override d3's decision
	!!   4. d1 (α=1, leftmost) has final say
	!!   5. If undetached after all filters → use match
	!!
	!! For α: d3 doesn't mention, d2 doesn't mention, d1 blocks → BLOCKED with default 1
	!! For β: d3 doesn't mention, d2 blocks, d1 doesn't override → BLOCKED with default 2
	!! For γ: d3 blocks, d2 doesn't override, d1 doesn't override → BLOCKED with default 3
	!!
	!! All three should be blocked with their respective defaults
	result = α + β + γ;  !! Should be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
