	!! P-brane (Plus Brane) selective binding test
	!! TODO: Implement P-brane [+a, b] syntax for selective binding
	!!
	!! P-branes allow selective binding of specific identifiers while
	!! keeping others detached. Syntax: [+ identifier1, identifier2]
	!!
	!! Example from NAMES_SEARCHES_N_BOUNDS.md:
	!!   secure = [/a, /b, /c]{result = a + b + c;};
	!!   partial =$ [+ a, b] secure.result;
	!!
	!! This would bind only 'a' and 'b' from parent scope,
	!! keeping 'c' detached (liberated).
	!!
	!! For now, this test just demonstrates the syntax is not yet implemented.

	result = 0;
