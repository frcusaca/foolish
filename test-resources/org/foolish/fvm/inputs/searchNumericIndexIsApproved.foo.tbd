{
	!! Test for numeric indexing with # operator
	!! Based on NAME_SEARCH_AND_BOUND.md sections:
	!! - "Backward Search from End": #-N for Nth-to-last value
	!! - "Forward Search from Beginning": #N for (N+1)th value (zero-indexed)

	data = {a=10; b=20; c=30; d=40; e=50;};

	!! Forward search (zero-based indexing)
	first = data#0;      !! First value: 10
	second = data#1;     !! Second value: 20
	third = data#2;      !! Third value: 30

	!! Backward search (negative indexing)
	last = data#-1;      !! Last value: 50
	second_last = data#-2;   !! Second-to-last: 40
	third_last = data#-3;    !! Third-to-last: 30

	!! Edge cases
	only_one = {x=99;}#0;    !! Should be 99
	also_last = {x=99;}#-1;  !! Should also be 99
}
