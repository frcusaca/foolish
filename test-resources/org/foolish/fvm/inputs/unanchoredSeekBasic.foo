    !! Test unanchored backward seek in branes
    !! Unanchored seek syntax: #-1, #-2, etc.
    !! Only negative offsets are allowed (excluding 0)

    !! Test 1: Basic unanchored seek
    a = 1;
    b = 2;
    c = #-1 + #-2;  !! c = 2 + 1 = 3

    !! Test 2: Complex expression with multiple seeks
    val1 = 3;
    val2 = 4;
    val3 = 5;
    sum = #-1 + #-2 + #-3;  !! sum = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12

    !! Test 3: Seeking across previous statements
    d = 10;
    e = 20;
    f = #-1 + #-2 + #-3 + #-4 + #-5 + #-6 + #-7 + #-8  !! Should find: 20 + 10 + 12 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 59
    g = { !! Let's make sure it respects boundaries
        aa= #-1; !! Constanic - #-1 inside nested brane shouldn't find f
        bb= 3;
        cc = bb * bb
    };
    h =$ #-1 ;   !! Syntactic sugar for h = #-1$ (tail of #-1)
    i = #-2$ ;   !! Tail of #-2
    j =^ #-3 ;   !! Syntactic sugar for j = #-3^ (head of #-3)
